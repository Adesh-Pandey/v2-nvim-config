# nvim-config

Personal nvim config

Starting vim journey. As a side text editor so may not be fast. But will be updating timely as I add on plugins.
Hoping to be more proficient in it.

I had some Packer problems with telescope, so switched to lazy. But it - I think - was the issue with loading order causing circular dependency.

also includes tmux config.
